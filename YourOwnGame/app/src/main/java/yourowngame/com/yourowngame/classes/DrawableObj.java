     * To make it easier for us I used a generic with unlimited params. Unfortunately
     * if we implement this interface Java changes the signature to OBJ[] which would
     * force us to provide obj with the same type. But we want to send different objects
     * and also how much we want (I know, this is against the principle of datatypes,

     * that you change OBJ[] allObjs back to OBJ... allObjs :)

     * Also important for this method: Keep errors as locally as possible and always keep
     * track of provided objects (because of generics and indexoutofbounds etc.) so I recommend
     * to provide parameters in a comment above the method: e.g. OBJ[0]: Activity
     * <p>
     * Although it might make sense in some cases, this method should/must NOT be static
     * in any case!

     * [at]Override [at]SafeVarargs
