/**
 * Constants interfaces are referencing NOT translateable (global) values [e.g. numbers, auth-tokens, arbitrary strings etc.].
 * If a string can be translated (sensefully) then place it into Strings.xml Resource file!
 *
 * Please group constants within superior Interface 'Constants' by additional interfaces [e.g. Constants > GameObject > {values}]
 *
 * Constants always in UPPER_CASE separated by dash
 *
 * Im a slightly unhappy about the Constants Interface, because Interfaces should be used for
 * inheritance and if this game gets further, the most classes depend on that special "interface"
 * which is basically just a placeholder for constants...
 *
 * Cohesion of other classes will suffer!
