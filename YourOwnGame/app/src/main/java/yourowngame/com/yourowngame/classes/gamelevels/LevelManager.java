/** Pattern: SINGLETON
 * Why using SparseArray over Hashmap or ArrayList?
 *      Sparsearray needs less memory than Hashmap and also has the ability to set elements into the list with gaps (arraylist can't do that).
 *      Only drawback of sparseArray: The get() method is mostly slower, because of the searching algorithm behind it and as well it isn't
 *      mapped like the Hashmap. But if we search for a level with .get(1) [NEVER USE GET, ALWAYS USE .valueAt() = FASTER] and save it to a temp. Level-Obj this drawback is not that dramatic.
 *      --> BUT be careful when iterating over SparseArray, if we assign from 1 upwards or have gaps, then we could get a null object, because there is NO foreach.*/
