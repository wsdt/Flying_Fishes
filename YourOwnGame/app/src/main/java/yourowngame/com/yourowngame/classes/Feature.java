    /** Following int should contain a string resource id. Which refers to a string which points
     * out what the user needs to do to achieve this assignment or e.g. what happens when the fruit
     * has been collected. Short: What happens when feature is activated.
     *
     * Examples:
     * - "Achieve 1500 points." --> but in strings.xml please use a placeholder for numbers (instead of 1500 -> e.g. %1$d)
     * - "Gather 2 Meloons." --> but in strings.xml please use a placeholder for numbers (instead of 1500 -> e.g. %1$d)
     *
     * So if you want both assignments above in your levelObj, just create two LevelAssigmentObjs
     * and put them into your level.
     *
     * As you hopefully had read above you should NOT include numbers in your resourceString, as we do
     * not want to create multiple levelAssignmentClass in following cases.
     * - "Achieve 1500 points."
     * - "Achieve 3500 points."
     *
     * To prevent here two LevelAssigment children we just craft the resource string with a placeholder,
     * so we can put the exact amount we want into the top variable "amount" which will be placed within
     * our string. So we only have ONE LevelAssigment Object for ALL "Achieve x points." assignments. :)
     *
     * So do not use this resource string without providing the placeholder values. E.g.
     * - Bad: getResources().getString(getResString_whatToDo());
     * - Good: String.format(getResources().getString(getResString_whatToDo()),getAmount());*/
