/**
 * Created on 18.02.2018.
 * Provides a BackgroundManager
 * Singleton, always just one BackgroundManager
 *
 * TODO: So we've got two options now how to show our GUI Content
 *
 * Option 1:
 *
 * We somehow manage to create an animation that draws one image after another
 * (fe -> cloud_1 has reached end of screen, cloud_2 will be drawn exactly
 * after cloud_1 has left the screen on the right side!)
 *
 * Option 2:
 *
 * We'll make the background blue (for heaven, red for hell and so on...) and build clouds (for heaven)
 * that will appear randomly! (which also means, that we're creating
 * a kind of unique-UI, because the clouds will never appear
 * in the same way, they'll always be somehow unique!
 * main question here is, will it look as good as if we draw it with Photoshop?
 *
 * My Opinion:
 *
 * number one will surely be more interesting, because the ability of photoshop
 * will take us further than creating it on our own.
 * BUT -> creating unique backgrounds is kinda surprising & will surely
 * convey something to the user. So every start on level One, will show
 * 'em other clouds on other positions.
 *
 * I'll leave it to you!
 *
