 *
 * KeyHandler, misleading title for TouchHandler, but has some history so ill leave it this way
 * Handles Touch-Actions
 *
 *
 * Questions to be answered:
 *
 * (1) Should the main GameObject playerOne constantly move forward?
 * Touching the screen will move him up, leaving the screen will let him fall down
 * In that case, we just need to test whether the screen is currently touched (UP is true, player moves
 * closer to NORTH) or not (UP is false, Player falls)
 *
 * ...
 *

public class KeyHandler {
    //Constants for y+={value} and y-={value} when clicking on or releasing screen (falling per second or similar) are in Constants interface!
