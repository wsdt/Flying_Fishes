# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# You can control the set of applied configuration files using the
# proguardFiles setting in build.gradle.
#
# For more details, see
#   http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/proguard.html

# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
#   public *;
#}

# Uncomment this to preserve the line number information for
# debugging stack traces.
-keepattributes SourceFile,LineNumberTable

# If you keep the line number information, uncomment this to
# hide the original source file name.
-renamesourcefileattribute SourceFile

######## Keep public methods of enemy/fruit suclasses explicitely, bc. curr. we call them only by reflection (and proguard does not detect that)
-keep class yourowngame.com.yourowngame.classes.actors.enemy.specializations.** {
    public <methods>;
}
-keep class yourowngame.com.yourowngame.classes.actors.fruits.specializations.** {
    public <methods>;
}
